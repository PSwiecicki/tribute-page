# Steve Jobs Tribute Page

## About

The idea for this page was taken from freeCodeCamp.
This is a simple page about the life of Steve Jobs.
It was mainly created using HTML and CSS.
The website is fully responsive.
I used JavaScript, to add two functionality.
First one show text when the user reaches them on the page.
Second one handles tablet's button click and turnes on/ turnes off a tablet screen.
