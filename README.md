# Steve Jobs Tribute Page

## About

The idea for this page was taken from freeCodeCamp.\
This is a simple page about the life of Steve Jobs.\
It was mainly created using HTML and CSS.\
The website is fully responsive.\
I used JavaScript, to add two functionality.\
First one show text when the user reaches them on the page.\
Second one handles tablet's button click and turnes on/ turnes off a tablet screen.
